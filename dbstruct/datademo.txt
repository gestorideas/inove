        description: "The combination of aging baby boomers and the upcoming changes of the Affordable Care Act means that the healthcare industry will rapidly continue to expand. As an independent healthcare consultant, you can offer management and data analysis for organizations like hospitals, labs and therapist offices to help implement solutions to improve efficiency and/or save money. This is a great opportunity to put that marketing or economics degree to use.",

A truck is a much less expensive investment than a brick-and-mortar restaurant and, according to Mobi Munch founder Josh Tang, the failure rate for food trucks is just 10 to 20 percent (as opposed to 60 to 90 percent for restaurants). With the right equipment and some great recipes, you can have your mobile eatery up and running in no time.",

        description: "It's been said before, but it bears repeating: mobile is now a non-negotiable for almost any business. Finding ways to go mobile is a challenge for many business owners. If your company can provide affordable mobile solutions to businesses that need them you'll find mobile consulting a rich business opportunity.

According to Jamie Turner, founder of a company called The 60-Second Marketer, there will be ongoing need for mobile assistance.

Research from the 60-Second Marketer indicates that there are more people on the planet who own a mobile device than who own a toothbrush, said Turner, who co-authored the new book Go Mobile (Wiley, January 2012) with Jeanne Hopkins. So it's safe to say that your prospects are using mobile. If you're in business, it's your job to be where your prospects are. Your prospects are in mobile right now.",

All that cross-cultural communication is creating a growing need for translators, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statisticsâ€™ Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010-11 Edition. It predicts a greater demand for interpreters and translators resulting from the broadening of international ties and growth in the number of non-English speakers in the United States will result in a projected 22 percent increase in the number individuals employed in this profession.

This translates into a big business opportunity for entrepreneurs who can bring foreign-language speakers together with businesses in need.",

        description: "Employees are increasingly mobile. In fact, it is estimated there will be 1.3 billion mobile workers by 2015. So how are employers supposed to keep track of what their workers are doing? The answer provides myriad business opportunities for entrepreneurs. One company, Exaktime, recently debuted a mobile time clock. There are also vehicle-tracking time clocks and time-clock apps. But employers often don't have the staff or the time to manage all this new data and distill it to what is needed for payroll and billing.

A company that could provide employee-monitoring services, as well as some additional outsourced human resources functions, would be in great demand right now.",

As aging baby boomers move into the senior citizen category, there will be a growing need for these mobile services that help keep boomers looking good without requiring them to make a trip to the salon.",
